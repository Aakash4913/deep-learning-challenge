README: Deep Learning Model for Alphabet Soup

This README provides instructions on how to use a deep learning model to predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations based on a given dataset. The process involves data preprocessing, model compilation, training, evaluation, optimization, and writing a report on the model's performance. The instructions assume the use of Google Colab and Python libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Start by uploading the starter file to Google Colab.
Read in the dataset, "charity_data.csv," into a Pandas DataFrame.
Identify the target variable(s) for the model.
Identify the feature variable(s) for the model.
Drop the EIN and NAME columns from the DataFrame.
Determine the number of unique values for each column.
For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.
Use the number of data points for each unique value to set a cutoff point for binning "rare" categorical variables into a new value called "Other."
Check if the binning was successful.
Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.
Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y, using the train_test_split function.
Scale the training and testing features datasets using StandardScaler.

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Design a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Determine the number of input features and nodes for each layer in your model.
Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
Optionally, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
Check the structure of the model.
Compile and train the model.
Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.
Evaluate the model using the test data to calculate the loss and accuracy.
Save the model's results to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5".

Step 3: Optimize the Model

Create a new Google Colab file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb".
Import the required dependencies and read in the "charity_data.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess the dataset as done in Step 1, adjusting for any modifications made during optimization attempts.
Design a new neural network model optimized to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
Save the optimized model's results to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5".

Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

Write a report on the performance of the deep learning model created for Alphabet Soup. The report should include the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the analysis.
Results:
Data Preprocessing:
Identify the target variable(s) for the model.
Identify the feature variable(s) for the model.
Identify the variable(s) to be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
Describe the number of neurons, layers, and activation functions chosen for the neural network model and the reasons behind these choices.
Indicate whether the target model performance of >75% accuracy was achieved.
Explain the steps taken to increase the model's performance.
